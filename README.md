</h3>

REQUIREMENTS
------------

- PHP >= 7.4.
- rustdesk >= 1.2.3
- mysql >= 5.7 or sqlite3


INSTALLATION
------------

### Installation using composer

If you do not have [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/), you may install it by following the instructions
at [getcomposer.org](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-nix).

You can then install dependencies using the following command:

~~~
composer install -vvv
~~~

### Install with Docker

Update your vendor packages

    docker-compose run --rm php composer update --prefer-dist
    
Run the installation triggers (creating cookie validation code)

    docker-compose run --rm php composer install    
    
Start the container

    docker-compose up -d
    
You can then access the application through the following URL:

    http://127.0.0.1:8000

**NOTES:** 
- Minimum required Docker engine version `17.04` for development (see [Performance tuning for volume mounts](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/osxfs-caching/))
- The default configuration uses a host-volume in your home directory `.docker-composer` for composer caches


CONFIGURATION
-------------

### Database

Edit the file `config/db.php` with real data, for example:

```php
return [
    'class' => 'yii\db\Connection',
    'dsn' => 'mysql:host=localhost;dbname=yii2basic',
    'username' => 'root',
    'password' => '1234',
    'charset' => 'utf8',
];
```

**NOTES:**
- Yii won't create the database for you, this has to be done manually before you can access it.
- Check and edit the other files in the `config/` directory to customize your application as required.
- The server uses a `sqlite` database by default


### Database Migration
You can migrate the database using the following command:
```shell
./yii migrate/up
```

RUN
-------------

~~~
./yii serve
~~~

You can now access it at http://localhost:8080
